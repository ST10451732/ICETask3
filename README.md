Project Description:

**Project Name:** Parentheses Validator

**Project Overview:**
The Parentheses Validator project aims to develop a Java function, `isValid`, that verifies the correctness of a sequence of parentheses in a given string. The function will analyze the input string to determine if the sequence of parentheses is well-formed, ensuring that for every open parenthesis, there is a corresponding closing parenthesis.

**Project Objectives:**
- Develop a Java function `isValid(s)` using both the `String` and `StringBuilder` classes.
- Validate the input string `s` to ensure it contains a sequence of parentheses ('(', ')', '{', '}', '[', ']') only.
- Determine if the input string is valid, i.e., every open parenthesis has a corresponding closing parenthesis and the parentheses are well-formed.
- Implement the function without utilizing the Stack data structure.

**Project Deliverables:**
- Java function `isValid(s)` that returns a boolean value indicating whether the input string `s` is valid or not.
- Documentation detailing the approach used to implement the function, including any relevant references or resources consulted during development.
- Test cases to validate the correctness of the function, including both valid and invalid input strings.

**Project Tasks:**
1. Develop the `isValid(s)` function to analyze the input string and determine its validity.
2. Test the function with various input strings to ensure it correctly identifies valid and invalid sequences of parentheses.
3. Document the implementation details, including the approach taken and any challenges encountered during development.
4. Prepare test cases based on the provided requirements to validate the functionality of the `isValid(s)` function.

**Resources:**
- Codecademy Java Documentation on StringBuilder: [StringBuilder Documentation](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/java/stringbuilder)

**Project Risks:**
- Inaccurate validation logic leading to incorrect results.
- Inefficient implementation affecting performance.
- Lack of understanding of the provided requirements leading to misinterpretation.
  
**Project Dependencies:**
- Availability of required development environments (e.g., Eclipse IDE, Git Bash).
- Access to relevant documentation and resources for Java programming and StringBuilder usage.

This project aims to provide a robust and efficient solution for validating sequences of parentheses in Java without utilizing the Stack data structure, ensuring the correctness and reliability of the `isValid(s)` function.
