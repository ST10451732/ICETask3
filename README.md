**Business Requirements Document**

**Project Name:** Java Programming Tasks

**Project Overview:**
The Java Programming Tasks project aims to develop three distinct functions in Java to address specific computational requirements. These functions are intended to be modular, efficient, and well-documented to ensure usability and maintainability.

**Project Objectives:**
1. Develop a function `isValid(s)` to validate the correctness of a sequence of parentheses in a given string.
2. Implement an infinite generator function `odd_squares_sum` that yields the sum of squares of odd numbers up to a specified limit.
3. Create a function `greatest_common_divisor` to determine the greatest common divisor of two input numbers.

**Project Scope:**
- The project will focus on implementing the specified functions using Java programming language.
- The functions should adhere to the provided requirements and constraints, such as not using the Stack data structure for `isValid(s)`.

**Project Deliverables:**
1. Java function `isValid(s)` that determines the validity of a sequence of parentheses in a string.
2. Infinite generator function `odd_squares_sum` that yields the sum of squares of odd numbers.
3. Java function `greatest_common_divisor` to calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
4. Documentation detailing the usage, inputs, outputs, and constraints of each function.
5. Test cases to validate the correctness and robustness of the implemented functions.

**Functional Requirements:**

**Function: isValid(s)**
- Description: This function validates the correctness of a sequence of parentheses in a given string.
- Inputs: A string `s` containing a sequence of parentheses ('(', ')', '{', '}', '[', ']').
- Outputs: Boolean value indicating whether the input string `s` is valid or not.
- Constraints: The function should not use the Stack data structure.
- Test Cases:
  1. Input: “{}{)}” | Expected Output: False (Invalid)
  2. Input: “” | Expected Output: False (Invalid)
  3. Input: “{[}]” | Expected Output: False (Invalid)
  4. Input: “()” | Expected Output: True (Valid)
  5. Input: “({[]})” | Expected Output: True (Valid)

**Function: odd_squares_sum**
- Description: An infinite generator function that yields the sum of squares of odd numbers up to a specified limit.
- Inputs: None (Limit may be implicitly defined).
- Outputs: Integer value representing the sum of squares of odd numbers.
- Constraints: The function should be capable of generating an infinite sequence.
  
**Function: greatest_common_divisor**
- Description: This function calculates the greatest common divisor of two input numbers.
- Inputs: Two integer values `a` and `b`.
- Outputs: Integer value representing the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`.
- Constraints: The input numbers `a` and `b` must be positive integers.

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
- The functions should be well-documented with clear explanations of their inputs, outputs, and behavior.
- Code readability and efficiency are important considerations for maintainability and performance.
- The project should adhere to coding standards and best practices for Java programming.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All functions should pass the provided test cases and any additional test cases identified during development.
- Documentation should be comprehensive and accessible to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
- The project should be delivered within the specified timeline with no critical defects.

**Project Timeline:**
- Start Date: [Insert Start Date]
- End Date: [Insert End Date]

**Project Risks:**
- Inaccurate implementation of function logic leading to incorrect results.
- Insufficient documentation affecting usability and understanding.
- Potential performance issues with the infinite generator function.

**Project Dependencies:**
- Availability of required development environments (e.g., Java IDE).
- Access to relevant documentation and resources for Java programming.
